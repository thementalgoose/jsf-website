## Me, Myself and I

My name is *Jordan*, but i'm also known by *TheMentalGoose* or *TheFatPanda*. I have been developing in some form or another since the long lost year of 2009, and I have a passion for technology. If you've like to know more about me or get into contact, checkout my [Curriculum Vitae](cv) 

## Instructions included, but no refreshments

This website is something i've made for myself, and to be able to easily share knowledge between people and communities. I've developed a pastebin alternative with markdown formatting support, a tutorials blog section whereby I can share tutorials to actions or services i've performed, as well as some promotional stuff for myself. Feel free to take a look around, have a browse, and contact me if you think I can help you!

## In the past of a future

I don't have much in terms of interest outside the world of technology. I like to develop and write whatever I can in my free time. I enjoy motorsport and adventuring where I can, I don't game much, but I do like to keep up to date with what is going on in the world of technology. I have been doing Java since I was 14 and enjoy doing the android development side of Java. I have aquired an *array* of languages since then including `C#`, `C++`, `Haskell`, and a lot of the major web languages (`XHTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, `PHP`, `MySQL`, `jQuery`, etc.). I am more than willing to pick up something new and add it to my collection!

## Which way is up?

I have currently secured a placement with [Roller agency](http://www.rolleragency.com), and am looking forward to going to work for them, and then with the final year of university, that's me sorted until 2018. Not 100% sure what I want to do after that, but the question is more "What should I do in the world of technology" than anything else.

## What to know now

Right now I have no real plans, other than completing my industry placement and University. My plan is to keep on going where-ever the flow goes. In the words of a lecturer of mine: *You don't yet know what you will know in the future, but you certainly do know that you don't know when you will know it and maybe that you won't know when you know it. You know now that you need to know what you will know, but if when you do know what you will need to know you don't know you know it, then you won't know that you now know what you needed to know, and so you know that you need to know something which you think you will know, but you actually know. If you know that you will never know what you will need to know, then you will forever know that should you need to know, you will know what you need to know.*
