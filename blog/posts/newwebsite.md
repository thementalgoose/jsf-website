# May the fourth (website) be with you

This is now the fourth revision of my website, which I like to think builds on the backbone of the previous website. This revision is somewhat minor, but I think brings together an important themeing overhaul which should make it more eye-popping and more responsive. As always, previous versions of my website can be viewed below

- [Version 1](/old/v1/), where everything is done from scratch
- [Version 2](/old/v2/), where bootstrap was used for the theming 

This time, I did things the same as revision 3, keeping a couple of the key components but adding a visual flair to the different pages

### Home

Home is just a landing page of sorts, not really important in any way or useful for that matter but I use it as my playground for different javascript views and components, something that catches the eye. [Go and check it out for yourself](/)

### CV

So between Revision 2 and 4, there are a lot of updates going on here. It became apparent from some opinions of users who had seen my website that it was missing a few key things. I made the personal reflection that my CV-Website was too spread out, requiring a massive web page to view all the information. I realised that that can be whittled down into the key skills and important facts that I wanted to get across, and so I condenced the website massively into CV, which could be potentially viewed in one web page, whilst still holding the ability for expansion. I modularised the CV to not include projects, and instead keep that under a separate section, of which I can expand as and when opportunities or projects finish. You can take a look at my CV [here](/cv/) if you're interested

### Projects

So projects is just a landing page for my projects that i've done. As this website continues to grow I plan to add promos as sub pages for the projects that need them. Who knows when this will be done, but hopefully one day! 

### Blog

So the blog i'm writing on now is a slight revamp from the previous one. The flat-file CMS I was using beforehand was a pain to integrate properly with the CI server, so i've simplified how the pages are stored in and loaded in. The php, whilst not the most elegant is a damn sight more elegant than it was before, which should mean it's easier for me to handle. Check out some of my other posts if you want too, but you know how these blogs normally go. You write a couple and then life gets in the way! 

## The future

So whilst this website is being polished by me in my downtime from work and uni commitments, I will be integrating an updated [Continuous Integration](?p=continuousdeployment) configuration which will handle my manual stuff automatically, and also utilising [prose.io](http://prose.io) for a simple CMS from Github. The future is hopefully bright!
